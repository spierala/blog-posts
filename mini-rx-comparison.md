*TLDR* 
MiniRx "Feature Stores" offer simple yet powerful state management.
How does MiniRx Feature Store compare to @ngrx/component-store and @datorama/akita?

*Disclaimer: I am the maintainer of MiniRx Store, I try to be fair, but it can be difficult ;)
To be clear: ComponentStore and Akita are great state management libraries. But there might be situations where MiniRx Store is just a better fit.*

## What is MiniRx?
MiniRx is a full-blown **Redux** Store powered by RxJS: It includes actions, reducers, meta reducers, memoized selectors and Redux DevTools support.

The Redux pattern is great to manage state at large scale, but it forces us to write boilerplate code (actions, reducers, dispatch actions).

For that reason, MiniRx **Feature Stores** offer a more simple form of state management: 
we can **bypass Redux boilerplate** and interact directly with a corresponding feature state with this API:
-   `setState()` update the feature state
-   `select()` select state from the feature state object as RxJS Observable
-   `effect()` run side effects like API calls and update feature state
-   `undo()` easily undo setState actions (requires UndoExtension)

MiniRx scales nicely with your state management requirements:

- Make hard things simple with the Redux `Store` API
- Keep simple things simple with the `FeatureStore` API

In most cases you can default to the `FeatureStore` API and fall back to the `Redux API` to implement the really complex features in your application.

## MiniRx FeatureStore vs. ComponentStore vs. Akita: FIGHT!

Let's shed some light on MiniRx Feature Store by comparing it with two other popular state management libraries: @ngrx/component-store and @datorama/akita.

## The candidates

#### Component Store
ComponentStore is a library that helps to manage local/component state. It can be used as an alternative to the "Service with a Subject" approach. It is build on top of RxJS/ReplaySubject. Services which extend ComponentStore expose state as RxJS Observables (using the `select` method). With the methods `setState` and `patchState` the state can be updated.

Docs: https://ngrx.io/guide/component-store

#### Akita
Akita describes itself as a "state management pattern": 
It offers a set of specialized classes like: `Store`, `Query`, `EntityStore` and more. 
Akita Store is build on top of RxJS/BehaviorSubject. 
By using the Akita classes we can build a reactive state service which exposes state as RxJS Observables 
(using `select` on a `Query` instance). The `update` method of `Store` is used to update the state.

Docs: https://datorama.github.io/akita/

#### MiniRx Feature Store
MiniRx is a "hybrid" Store. It uses Redux and RxJS BehaviorSubject under the hood and 
exposes the powerful Redux `Store` API (which is very similar to @ngrx/store and @ngrx/effects). 
At the same time MiniRx allows you to bypass the infamous Redux boilerplate with the `FeatureStore` API. 
You can create a reactive state service by extending FeatureStore. 
RxJS Observables (returned by the `select` method) inform about state changes 
and the state can be changed by calling `setState`.

Docs: https://mini-rx.io/docs/fs-quick-start

Mhhh..., this sounds all very similar, but where are the differences then?

### 1. Setup

What does the basic setup of a reactive "State Service" look like?

All setups share the same ingredients: A state interface and initial state.
```typescript
interface CounterState {
    count: number;
}

const initialState: CounterState = {
    count: 42
}
```

#### MiniRx Feature Store
```typescript
@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
export class CounterStateService extends FeatureStore<CounterState> {

    count$: Observable<number> = this.select(state => state.count);

    constructor() {
        super('counter', initialState)
    }

    increment() {
        this.setState(state => ({count: state.count + 1}))
    }

    decrement() {
        this.setState(state => ({count: state.count - 1}))
    }
}
```
MiniRx Feature Store has to provide a "feature key": 'counter' (see `super('counter', initialState)`). 
The key is used to register the "counter" state in the global state object.

#### Component Store
```typescript
@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
export class CounterStateService extends ComponentStore<CounterState> {

    count$: Observable<number> = this.select(state => state.count);

    constructor() {
        super(initialState)
    }

    increment() {
        this.setState(state => ({count: state.count + 1}))
    }

    decrement() {
        this.setState(state => ({count: state.count - 1}))
    }
}
```

The Component Store setup looks very similar, however the feature key is not provided 
because every `ComponentStore` instance lives independently.

#### Akita
```typescript
@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
@StoreConfig({ name: 'counter' })
export class CounterStateService extends Store<CounterState> {
    constructor() {
        super(initialState)
    }

    increment() {
        this.update(state => ({count: state.count + 1}))
    }

    decrement() {
        this.update(state => ({count: state.count - 1}))
    }
}

@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})
export class CounterQuery extends Query<CounterState> {
    count$: Observable<number> = this.select(state => state.count);

    constructor(store: CounterStateService) {
        super(store);
    }
}
```
The Akita setup is the most boilerplaty. Extending `Store` is similar to the other setups. 
A feature key is provided via the `@StoreConfig` decorator.
But to access the state you have to extend `Query` and provide the `Store` instance.

Also, the components need to talk to both the `Query` instance and the `Store` instance in order to read and write state.

### 2. Bundle Sizes
Regarding the basic setup, let's also look the corresponding bundle sizes (using source-map-explorer). 

#### MiniRx Feature Store
combined: 152.39 KB

#### Component Store
combined: 152.25 KB

#### Akita
combined: 151.61 KB

Akita is the most lightweight, and MiniRx is almost 1 KB bigger. 
But keep in mind that MiniRx Feature Store uses Redux under the hood 
and the Redux API is always available. Using the MiniRx Redux API will not add much to the total bundle size.

### 2.1. Bundle Sizes when adding Redux

#### MiniRx Feature Store + Store API (Store + Effects) using [Angular Integration (mini-rx-store-ng)](https://mini-rx.io/docs/angular#register-effects)
combined: 156.9 KB

#### NgRx Component Store + NgRx Store
combined: 164.17 KB

#### NgRx Component Store + NgRx Store + NgRx Effects
combined: 171.45 KB

You can review the different setups in this repo and run source-map-explorer yourself: https://github.com/spierala/mini-rx-comparison

### 3. Local or global state
How do the different stores relate to local (component state) and global state? What is the store lifespan?

#### MiniRx Feature Store
MiniRx at its heart is a Redux Store with one global state object ("Single source of truth"). 
MiniRx Feature Stores register a "slice" of state into the global state object.
The focus of MiniRx is clearly global state which has the lifespan of the application.
But Feature Stores are destroyable... Their state can be removed from the global state object. 
Therefore, Feature Stores can be used for "Local Component State", which has the lifespan of a component. 
See an example in the [MiniRx Angular demo](https://angular-demo.mini-rx.io/#/counter).

#### Component Store
Component Stores live independently and are not related to something like a global state (e.g. when using @ngrx/store). 
The lifespan of a Component Store can be bound to a component ("Local Component State"), but it can also take the lifespan of the application.

#### Akita
The Akita Stores live independently next to each other. There is no real global state. You can use Akita Stores (which are destroyable too) for "Local Component State" following [this guide](https://datorama.github.io/akita/docs/angular/local-state) from the Akita docs.

### 4. Redux DevTools
#### MiniRx Feature Store
MiniRx can use Redux DevTools using the [Redux DevTools Extension](https://mini-rx.io/docs/ext-redux-dev-tools). 
Every Feature Store state becomes part of the global state object, and it can be inspected with the Redux DevTools.

#### Component Store
There is no official solution for Redux DevTools with Component Store.

#### Akita
Akita has a [PlugIn for Redux DevTools support](https://datorama.github.io/akita/docs/enhancers/devtools). 
FYI: The separate Store states are merged into one big state object to make all state inspectable with the Redux DevTools. See the Akita DevTools source [here](https://github.com/datorama/akita/blob/master/libs/akita/src/lib/devtools.ts).

### 5. Cross-state selection
How easily can we select state from other store instances and pull that state into our current State Service?

#### MiniRx Feature Store
Every Feature Store state integrates into the global state object. Therefore, the corresponding feature states can be selected at anytime from the `Store`(!) instance using `store.select`.
Alternatively you can use RxJS combination operators like `combineLatest` or `withLatestFrom` to combine state from other Feature Stores with state Observables of your current Feature Store.

#### Component Store
The Component Store `select` method also accepts a bunch of Observables (see docs [here](https://ngrx.io/guide/component-store/read#combining-selectors)). 
Like this it is straight-forward to depend on state of other ComponentStore instances.

#### Akita
Akita has `combineQueries` to combine state from different `Query` instances. `combineQueries` is basically RxJS `combineLatest`. 
See the Akita combineQueries source [here](https://github.com/datorama/akita/blob/master/libs/akita/src/lib/combineQueries.ts).

### 6. Memoized Selectors

Memoized selectors can help to improve performance by reducing the number of computations of selected state. 
The most common selectors API (`createSelector`) is great for Composition: Build selectors by combining existing selectors.

Examples for memoized selectors: 
- [NgRx Store selectors](https://ngrx.io/guide/store/selectors)
- [Redux Reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect)

#### MiniRx Feature Store
MiniRx comes with memoized selectors out-of-the-box. 
You can use the same `createFeatureSelector` and `createSelector` functions for the Redux `Store` API and for the `FeatureStore` API.

Read more in the [Feature Store memoized selectors documentation](https://mini-rx.io/docs/select-feature-state#memoized-selectors).

Example code from the Angular Demo: [Todos State Service](https://github.com/spierala/mini-rx-angular-demo/blob/main/src/app/modules/todo/state/todos-state.service.ts#L29)

#### Component Store
There is no official solution for Component Store. 
You could add @ngrx/store to use the memoized selectors, but it would probably be overkill to add the NgRx Redux Store just to use the selectors.

#### Akita
No memoized selectors.

### 7. Effects
Effects are used to trigger side effects like API calls. 
We can also handle race-conditions more easily within an Effect by using RxJS flattening operators (`switchMap`, `mergeMap`, etc.).

#### MiniRx Feature Store
MiniRx FeatureStore has Effects (https://mini-rx.io/docs/effects-for-feature-store).
Feature Store Effects have their equivalent in the Redux API: https://mini-rx.io/docs/effects

#### Component Store
Yes, there are Effects: https://ngrx.io/guide/component-store/effect

#### Akita
Yes, there are Effects: https://datorama.github.io/akita/docs/angular/effects. 
Effects come with a separate package (@datorama/akita-ng-effects).
The Effects API is not tied to a `Store` instance.

### 8. Undo
How can we undo state changes?

#### MiniRx Feature Store
MiniRx has the [UndoExtension](https://mini-rx.io/docs/ext-undo-extension) to support Undo of state changes. 
This is especially helpful if you want to undo optimistic updates (e.g. when an API call fails). Both the `FeatureStore` and the Redux `Store` API can undo specific state changes.
Feature Store exposes the `undo` method. 

Read more in the MiniRx docs: [Undo a setState Action](https://mini-rx.io/docs/update-feature-state#undo-setstate-actions-with-undo)

#### Component Store
No support for undo.

#### Akita
Akita has a State History PlugIn to undo state changes (https://datorama.github.io/akita/docs/plugins/state-history/). 
The API is much bigger than the one of MiniRx. But it seems to be difficult to undo a very specific state change (which is important when undoing optimistic updates).

### 9. Immutable State
Immutability is key when using state management: We only want to allow explicit state changes using the corresponding API (e.g. by using `setState`, `update` or by dispatching an Action in Redux). 
Mutating state however, might lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.
Immutable state helps to avoid such accidental state changes.

#### MiniRx Feature Store
MiniRx offers the [Immutable State Extension](https://mini-rx.io/docs/ext-immutable) to enforce immutable data. 
When the `ImmutableStateExtension` is added to the MiniRx Store both the Redux `Store` API and the `FeatureStore` API will use immutable data.
The Immutable State Extension "deepfreezes" the global state when state is updated. Mutating state will throw an exception.

#### Component Store
There is nothing in ComponentStore which can enforce immutability.

#### Akita
Akita "deepfreezes" the state object when state is updated (only in DEV mode) See the corresponding source code here: https://github.com/datorama/akita/blob/master/libs/akita/src/lib/store.ts#L181

### 10. Framework-agnostic
#### MiniRx Feature Store
MiniRx is framework-agnostic. You can use MiniRx with any framework or even without framework.

See here the MiniRx Svelte Demo: https://github.com/spierala/mini-rx-svelte-demo

#### Component Store
Component Store is tied to Angular. Angular is a peer dependency in the [package.json](https://github.com/ngrx/platform/blob/master/modules/component-store/package.json#L25).

#### Akita
Akita is also framework-agnostic. You can see in this article how Svelte and Akita play together: [Supercharge Your Svelte State Management with Akita](https://netbasal.com/supercharge-your-svelte-state-management-with-akita-f1f9de5ef43d)

## Notes
### How does the Feature Store work?
Feature Stores uses Redux under the hood:
Behind the scenes a Feature Store is creating a feature reducer and a "setState" action.
MiniRx dispatches that action when calling `setState()` and the corresponding feature reducer will update the feature state accordingly.
